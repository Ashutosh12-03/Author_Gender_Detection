# Author_Gender_Detection
The project aims at detecting the author of the input text, preferably, a short text of 10-600 words, using machine learning techniques. It is mostly useful in detecting the fake account or fake appeals made by someone. Most of the Social Media apps or websites, such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, etc. , and other web applications such as e-mail, blog, chat rooms, etc. are mostly text based, and criminals make approaches for hacking or penetrate the systems on other end by creating fake accounts and doing social engineering attacks. A step towards its prevention can be to identify the author of the text, and report if a suspicion can be detected. The appropriate features that can lead to an accurate detection of gender is still a predominant field for research. Machine Learning, somehow, eases the solution to tackle such problem. It provides Support Vector Machine, Bayesian Logistic Regression, and AdaBoost decision tree algorithms, which are used for gender identification based on the proposed features, and have proved to be efficient in depictions. This project uses Support Vector Machine after many trials with varying parameters of SVM itself, with variation in size of training dataset.
